# ðŸš€ Node.js CI/CD Workflow with Docker

This repository demonstrates a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the CI/CD process for a Node.js project, including Docker image build and push to a private container registry.

---

## ðŸ”§ What This Workflow Does

This CI/CD workflow is triggered on:
- Push to the `dev` branch
- Pull requests targeting the `dev` branch

The workflow performs the following steps:
1. **Checks out the latest code**
2. **Installs Node.js dependencies**
3. **Builds a Docker image** using the project source
4. **Pushes the Docker image** to a custom container registry
